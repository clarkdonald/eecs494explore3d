'Textures' describes the options for texture loading and rendering.

  Anisotropy improves how Textures look when rendered at extreme angles,
  but it makes rendering slower.  I recommend setting it to '0' for 2D
  games and setting it at a minimum of '2' for 3D games.  '8' should be
  more or less sufficient for any game.

  Bilinear_Filtering improves how Textures look when they are being
  rendered at a different resolution than that at which they were
  created.  It makes rendering slower, but it is recommended that
  this always be set to '1'.

  Mipmapping causes the rendering system to use multiple sizes of a
  given Texture.  It improves rendering quality and reduces CPU
  usage.  It is recommended that this always be set to '1'.
  
'Video' describes the more general options for rendering.

  API can be either 'OpenGL' or 'DX9'.  If either API is unavailable
  or an invalid API string is set, the default API will be used.
  'DX9' is generally faster on Windows machines.

  Full_Screen should be '0' while debugging, and '1' for most, but
  not all, releases.

  Multisampling improves stability of rendering when there is lots
  of motion.  It reduces the problem of jaggies and gives most edges
  a slightly softer look.  Testing for performance problems, I recommend
  setting it to a minimum of '2' and possibly as high as '4' or '8'.
  Multisampling is a specific variant of anti-aliasing.

  Resolution should be set to the resolution at which you want the
  game to be rendered.  Keep in mind that certain resolutions are
  impossible when rendering Full_Screen.  Setting Width/Height to
  '0' causes SDL to choose an optimal value for Full_Screen rendering.

  Vertical_Sync limits rendering frequency to the refresh rate of the
  monitor.  This eliminates the problem of tearing but can significantly
  impair the game playing experience if performance is very poor.
